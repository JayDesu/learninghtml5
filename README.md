# learninghtml5
This is me just learning HTML5

I'm using this space to learn things about HTML. I was a relatively competent HTML coder 10 years ago but I feel like I need to catch up to where things are (currently with HTML5).
My goals are;
Goal 1. Build a basic website with
  a. Home Page
  b. Gallery
  c. Import page (import certain file types only i.e. jpg, txt and xlsx files only)
  d. A page with something HTML5 flashy
Goal 2. Build a simple HTML5 game
  a. Any game whatsoever but translate what I knew from ActionScript 2 to HTML5
  b. <second criterian tbd>
Goal 3. Publish a website
  a. Doesn't have to be the one in Goal 1 but something so I understand the website creation process outside of using a website building service such as Squarespace or Wix.
This is to update what I used to know up to the current day.
